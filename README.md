# Phase_4_Project
# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the process of building a **Sentiment Analysis** model on a dataset of tweets related to various products and companies. The project covers multiple stages of data analysis, from understanding the business problem to preparing data, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
  - **Imbalanced-learn**: For handling class imbalances.
  - **Transformers**: For advanced NLP techniques using pre-trained models.
  - **Joblib**: For saving and loading models.
  - **Torch**: For deep learning (if applicable).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** based on the product or company mentioned. The following steps are included:

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding**:
   - Loading and exploring the dataset of tweets.
   - Understanding the business context and sentiment analysis objectives.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the text data by removing unnecessary characters, stop words, and applying text normalization techniques like lemmatization.
   - Visualizing the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Several machine learning models are trained, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - The dataset is split into training and test sets, and various models are evaluated for performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Using metrics such as **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report** to evaluate the models.
   - **Over-sampling** techniques like **RandomOverSampler** are used to handle class imbalance.

5. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Utilizing pre-trained deep learning models from **Transformers** to enhance sentiment classification accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains tweets about various products and companies. It includes:
- Tweet text
- Sentiment label (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral)

The dataset is loaded as a **CSV file** for further processing and analysis.
