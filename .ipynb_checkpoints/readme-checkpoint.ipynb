    "# Phase_4_Project\n",
    "# Sentiment Analysis Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the process of building a **Sentiment Analysis** model on a dataset of tweets related to Apple and Google products. The objective is to classify the sentiment of tweets into three categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**. This project covers multiple stages of data analysis, from understanding the business problem to preparing data, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to classify sentiments in tweets mentioning **Apple** and **Google** products into three categories: **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. Sentiment analysis is a key application of natural language processing (NLP) that helps organizations understand public opinion at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple and Google heavily rely on the perception of their customers towards their products. As customers continue to provide feedback on platforms like **Twitter (X)**, itâ€™s crucial to analyze the sentiment of this feedback. This project aims to build a model that helps classify tweets based on the sentiment they express.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Objective**: Build an accurate NLP model to classify tweets mentioning Apple and Google products into sentiment categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Specific Objectives**:\n",
    "  - Explore and analyze tweet data to provide actionable insights.\n",
    "  - Preprocess the data using NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization.\n",
    "  - Evaluate the performance of the classifiers using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 score).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Initial Data Loading and Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is loaded using **pandas**, and the initial inspection reveals that it contains tweets along with their respective sentiment labels. The dataset is provided in a CSV file format (`judge-1377884607_tweet_product_company.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the data, the following commands provide insight into the dataset:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.head()  # Show first few rows of the dataset\n",
    "df.info()  # Dataset information (types and nulls)\n",
    "df.describe()  # Statistical summary of the dataset\n",
    "df.shape  # Dimensions of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the text data undergoes several preprocessing steps, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text cleaning**: Removing special characters and irrelevant information.\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Breaking down the text into individual words.\n",
    "- **Removing stop words**: Filtering out common but non-informative words (e.g., \"the\", \"and\").\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Word Cloud Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "A **WordCloud** is generated to visualize the most frequent terms in the dataset. This helps in understanding which words are most commonly used in tweets related to Apple and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple machine learning models were trained, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.\n",
    "- **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A robust model for text classification.\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric model for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Data Splitting and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from **sklearn**. The models are then trained on the training set and tested on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Handling Class Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset has imbalanced classes, techniques like **RandomOverSampler** from **imblearn** are used to oversample the minority class and balance the class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are evaluated using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified tweets.\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts.\n",
    "- **Classification Report**: A detailed report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Performance Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The models were evaluated on the test set, and their performances were compared. The results showed that the **LinearSVC** model performed the best in terms of F1-score, closely followed by **Logistic Regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of evaluation for the **LinearSVC** model:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "classification_report(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)).plot()\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Advanced Techniques (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "For further improvement, **pre-trained deep learning models** from the **Transformers** library were used to enhance sentiment classification accuracy. These models provide a powerful approach to NLP tasks, leveraging state-of-the-art transformer architectures like **BERT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully developed a sentiment analysis model for classifying tweets about Apple and Google products. By using **Logistic Regression**, **LinearSVC**, and **KNN**, the model was able to predict the sentiment of tweets with reasonable accuracy. Future work could involve fine-tuning the pre-trained transformer models to achieve even better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains tweets with text about Apple and Google products. The labels are classified into three categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**. This dataset is essential for training and testing the sentiment analysis models.\n"
